Introduction        {#intro}
============

(Attest that the standard meets the requirements for Draft Standard
and name who is attesting it.  Describe how many implementations were
tested or surveyed.  Quickly characterize the deployment level and
where the standard can be found in deployment.  Call out, and if
possible, briefly describe any notably difficult or poorly
interoperable features and explain why these still meet the
requirement.  Assert any derivative conclusions: if a high-level
system is tested and shown to work, then we may conclude that the
normative requirements of that system (all sub-system or lower-layer
protocols, to the extent that a range of features is used) have also
been shown to work.)
      
Methodology
===========

(Describe how the information in the report was obtained.  This should
be no longer than the summary.)

Exceptions
==========

(This section might read "Every feature was implemented, tested, and
widely interoperable without exception and without question".  If that
statement is not true, then this section should cover whether any
features were thought to be problematic.  Problematic features need
not disqualify a protocol from Draft Standard, but this section should
explain why they do not (e.g., optional, untestable, trace, or
extension features).)

Details
=======

[Any other justifying or background information can be included here.
In particular, any information that would have made the summary or
methodology sections more than a few paragraphs long may be created as
a detail section and referenced.

In this section, it would be good to discuss how the various
considerations sections played out.  Were the security considerations
accurate and dealt with appropriately in implementations?  Was real
internationalization experience found among the tested
implementations?  Did the implementations have any common monitoring
or management functionality (although note that documenting the
interoperability of a management standard might be separate from
documenting the interoperability of the protocol itself)?  Did the
IANA registries or registrations, if any, work as intended?]
